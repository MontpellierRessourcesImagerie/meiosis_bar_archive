Meiosis bar tool is an ImageJ macro used to analyse images of synaptonemal complexes of spermatocytes chromosomes spreads.
It uses: 
- Jerome Mutterer's Actionbar plugin (can be downloaded using imageJ>Help>Update>Manage Sites through selection of IBMP-CNRS site).
- Ignacio Arganda Carreras & Curtis Rueden skeletonize 3D plugin available here https://github.com/fiji/Skeletonize3D. Meiosis bar Macro was used/tested with 2.2.2 version of this plugin. 

The whole macro was tested using ImageJ 1.53t, Java 1.8.0_172 and a 64-bits windows OS. 

Mind spaces or fancy characters should be avoided (input folders and parents folders, file names).
